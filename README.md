# JAX: Accelerated Machine Learning and Scientific Computing

![JAX Logo](https://github.com/google/jax/raw/main/images/jax_logo_250px.png)

JAX is an open-source library developed by Google Research for high-performance numerical computing. It provides composable transformations of numerical Python programs, enabling automatic differentiation and just-in-time (JIT) compilation, which makes it particularly well-suited for machine learning and scientific computing.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Differentiation**: JAX provides automatic differentiation (autograd) capabilities, enabling gradient-based optimization techniques commonly used in machine learning.
  
- **Just-In-Time Compilation**: JAX allows for efficient compilation of numerical Python code, resulting in significant performance improvements, especially on accelerators like GPUs and TPUs.

- **Functional Programming**: JAX emphasizes functional programming constructs, enabling composability and allowing for the creation of high-level abstractions.

- **Interoperability with NumPy**: JAX provides an interface compatible with NumPy, making it easy to integrate with existing scientific computing workflows.

## Installation

You can install JAX via pip and also based on your required version:

```bash
pip install jax jaxlib
